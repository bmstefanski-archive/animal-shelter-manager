=========

I'm making this program to remind the basics of java oop.  
You can add/delete your pet or check shelter's status. Everything is saved to the file (and loaded on the startup).

## How to use it? ##   
You can find a few commands below, if you found any **typo** please inform me.  

| Command                             | Description                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| /add                                | Add your pet                        | 
| /remove                             | Remove your pet                     | 
| /status                             | Check shelter's status              | 
| /list                               | Display all pets with their **ID**s |

## Are you going to add something? ##
**Yes, of course. I hope this project will have a lot of functions, examples below:**
- Add more functions for Animal Object (health level, gender, and the like..),
- Export shelter's status to .csv or .pdf file,
- Unit tests.
